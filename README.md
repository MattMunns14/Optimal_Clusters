# Optimal_Clusters
Techniques for efficiently finding optimal number of clusters.

Uses Bayesian optimization and brute force search to find an optimal number of clusters to use with a clustering algorithm. 
Generates sample two dimensional normal data to test accuracy and efficiency with. 

I'd like to add additional clustering methods (GMM with EM, Bayesian GMM) and try some other optimization/searching methods.
